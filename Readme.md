## **Approach and Methodologies**
The project employs both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for analysis and predictions. The following algorithms have been implemented:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

These algorithms were applied to the dataset to extract insights, compare performances, and determine the most suitable model for price prediction. Detailed analysis and visualization were performed in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure a robust evaluation process.

## **Future Possibilities**
- **Business Applications**: The model can be refined and used to assist businesses in setting competitive prices for laptops based on market trends and configurations.
- **User Input Program**: Develop a user-friendly application where users can input desired laptop specifications to get an estimated price in real-time.
- **Web Application Deployment**: Integrate the model into a web application using frameworks like Streamlit or Flask for broader accessibility.
- **Integration with E-commerce**: Partner with e-commerce platforms to provide dynamic price recommendations for laptops listed on their websites.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Enhance the dataset by including more laptop models, regional pricing, and brand-specific trends for better predictions.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incorporate APIs to fetch real-time data on market prices and hardware trends for dynamic predictions.
- **Recommendation System**: Build a system that not only predicts prices but also recommends laptops based on user preferences and budget constraints.
